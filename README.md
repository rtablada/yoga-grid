# Yoga Grid

> **NOTE** this project is in a VERY early stage and may change drastically.
> Some documented features may not be implemented yet.

Yoga is a modern set of mixins and variables for SASS to use the power of flexbox.
This library is written to play well with existing Bourbon and Neat sites, but does not actually require either library.

## Installation

The preferred installation of this is to use Bower or NPM to install this package.

```sh
bower install yoga-sass
```

From there, add the `assets` directory in your SASS import paths.
Finally, just `@import "yoga";` in your SCSS or SASS file.

## Mixin Docs

This project is documented using SASSdoc and the full documentation can be seen on GH Pages: http://rtablada.github.io/yoga-sass
